## Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Course Project - Getting and Cleaning Data  

### Overview:
The **“run_analysis.R”** script creates a tidy dataset file from the **“Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set”**. The resulting tidy file provides a summary of 
the mean and standard deviation values for each measurement taken for each subject while performing the six primary activities that we measured. 

### Objectives:
The derived tidy dataset complies with the following project objectives:

1. Merge the training and the test data sets to create a single data set of all respondents.
2. Extracts only the measurements related to mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Display the activity lable for each activity undertaken by the subjects as character variable in the data set.
4. Ammend the labels of the data set with descriptive variable names that adhere the tidy data requirements.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each subject's measurements within each activity performed.  

### How to use:
Download the **“run_analysis.R”** script into a R working directory and execute script within your **R** environment. The script will create a tidy delimited flat file dataset **(TidyDataSet.txt)**, with the original downloaded dataset.

The final resulting **“TidyDataSet.txt”** is available for comparison.
